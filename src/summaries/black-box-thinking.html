      <i>'A cornerstone to success is a progressive attitude towards failure'</i>
    </br>
  </br>
  
    <p>
      <b>Intro:</b> The book explores the ways in which failure, 
      despite all the pain associated with it, is actually one of our greatest assets. 
      It shows how failure can be used to our advantage - how it's in fact key to progress and success.</p>

        "Be wrong as fast as we can... which basically means, we're gonna screw up. let's just admit that.
        Let's not be afraid of that. But let's do it as fast as we can so we can get to the answer. You can't
        get to adulthood before you go through puberty. I won't get it right the first time, but I will get it wrong 
        really soon, really quick" - Andrew Stanton, director of <i>Finding Nemo</i> and <i>WALL-E</i>

                  Every aircraft is equipped with a device called <b>Black Box</b>. The device records instructions sent 
                  to the onboard electronic systems, as well as the conversations and sounds in the cockpit.
                  If there is an accident, the data from the boxes is analysed and the reasons for the accident excavated.<br>
                  This ensures that the procedures can be changed so that the same error never happens again.<br>
                  In other words, the aviation industry embraces failure and learns from it.
                  (Failure is not regarded as an idictment of the specific pilot who messes up, but a precious learning opportunity
                  for all pilots, all airlines, and all regulators).
                <br>
                <br>
                  As a result, aviation has attained an impressive safety record: only 1 in 2.4 million flights ends in tragedy.
                <br>
                  This willingness and tenacity to investigate the lessons that often exist when we fail, and developing a 
                  mindset to learn from it is called <b>Black Box Thinking.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                   In the healthcare industry, however, things are very different.<br>
                   Failures are not seen as an inevitable consequence of complexity, but as indictments of those who make them, it is difficult to speak about concerns as 
                   making mistakes is considered to demonstrate incompetence.<br>
                   Because of this attitude towards failure, healthcare institutions have not routinely collected data on how
                   accidents happen, and thus cannot detect meaningful patterns, let alone learn from them.<br>
                   The consequences are profound: around 400,000 people die every year from preventable medical issues in US hospitals alone.<br>
                   This is equivalent to two fully packed jumbo jets crashing every day or a 9/11 occuring every two months.

                  On 15 Jan 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 took-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport.
                  Less than two minutes after take-off, a flock of Canada geese suddenly loomed into view to the right of the plane. Two birds
                  flew into the right engine and at least one more into the left. After a series of loud thuds, the plane came to a halt and the engines had lost thrust.
                  Captain Chelsey Sullenberger ultimately landed the plane on the Hudson River. It was a brilliantly judged manoeuvre.
                  The public and academics hailed him as a hero who saved more than a hundered lives.</p>
                  <br>
                  But the aviation experts took a different view. They glimpsed a bigger picture. They sighted not just Sullenberger's individual brilliance but
                  also the system in which he operated. Some made references to 'Crew Resource Management'. Still others credited checklists
                  and clever ergonomic design.</p>
                  Checklists originally emerged from a series of crashes in the 1930s. Ergonomic cockpit design was born out of series of accidents involving B-17s. Crew Resource Management
                  emerged from the wreckage of United Airlines 173.</p>
                  <br>
                  This is the paradox of success: it is built upon failure.</p>
                  <br>
                  Another example of a system that focuses on learning from failures is - Toyota Production Systems (TPS).<br>
                  In Toyota, if anybody on the production line has a problem, or observes an error, they pull a cord which halts production across the plant.
                  Senior executives rush over to see what has gone wrong and, if an employee is having difficulty performing their job, help them.
                  The error is then assessed, lessons learned, and the system adapted. TPS is one of the most successful techniques in industrial history.</p>

                    Juan Rivera, a 19-year-old with a history of mental illness was accused in 1992 of raping and murdering an eleven-year-old girl,<br>
                    and sentenced to life in prison. Thirteen years later, a DNA test proved Juan’s innocence.<br>
                    But prosecutors wouldn’t budge, and it took another six years for his release. So why was it so hard for the prosecutors to admit their mistake?<br>
                    In general, people are highly averse to admitting that they’ve made a mistake. In fact, we hate admitting that we’ve made an error more than we hate making mistakes themselves!<br>
                    Perhaps the hardest part of admitting mistakes is the first part – admitting to yourself that you’ve made one.
                    Admitting error compromises our self-esteem, especially when it’s about something important.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    'Cognitive Dissonance' occurs when mistakes are too threatening to admit to, so they are reframed or ignored.
                    This can be thought of as an internal fear of failure: how we struggle to admit mistakes to ourselves.
                  It hinders progress because the first step in learning from our failures is to admit it.

              A ceramics teacher announced on the opening day of class that he was dividing the students into two groups.<br>
              The first group was told that they would be graded on quantity - the higher the number of pots, the higher the grades.<br>
              The second group would be graded on quality - they just had to bring along their one 'perfect' pot.<br>
              <br>
              The results were emphatic: the highest quality pots were produced by the first group (the group graded for quanity).<br>
              It seems while the 'quantity' group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the 'quality'<br>
               group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had nothing more to show than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.<br>
               <br>
               The story hints at the dangers of 'perfectionism': of trying to get things right first time.<br>
               <br>
               The desire for perfection rests upon two fallacies: The first resides in the miscalculation that you can create the optimal solution
               sitting in a cubicle or an ivory tower and thinking things through rather than getting out into the real world and testing assumptions, thus finding flaws.<br>
               The second fallacy is the fear of failure: You are so worried about messing up that you never even get on the field of play.<br>

              (MVP - Minimum viable product is a prototype with sufficient features in common with the proposed final product
              so that it can be tested on early adopters. It's basically 'trial & error' on steriods.)<br>
              <br>
              Nick Swinmurn, a technology entrepreuner, created a rather unusual MVP. He reckoned the world needed a website in order to purchase 
              a stylish collection of shoes.<br>
              Instead of going about this in the usual way - raising millions in capital, creating a vast inventory, and developing
              relationships with all the various manufacturers - he toured various shops and asked if he could take photos of their shoes. <br>
              In return for allowing him to take the pictures and posting them online, he said he would come back and purchase the shoes at 
              full price if customers registered their interest.<br>
              By this process, Swinmurn was able to test the so-called value hyposthesis: do customers actually want to buy shoes online? It 
              turned out that they did.<br>
              <br>
              But he discovered a host of other things, too. <br>
              By interacting with real customers he learned things he could never have imagined in advance. He had to deal with returns, complaints, and taking online payment.<br>
              By building a product and getting it out, Swinmurn learned much more than what he could have by just relying on market research.

                    The ATM was a response to the problem of getting hold of cash outside opening hours. It was invented by 
                    John Shephard-Barron while lying in the bath one night, worrying because he had forgotten to go to the bank.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dropbox was a response to problem of forgetting a flash drive and thus not having access to important files.
                    (Drew Houston thought of the idea while travelling on a bus from Boston to NY. He opened his laptop and realised 
                    he had forgotten his flashdrive, which meant that he couldn't do the work he wanted to).<br>
                    <br>
                    The collapsible buggy was a response to the impracticality of unwieldy prams (Owen Maclaren, the designer, came up 
                    with the idea after watching his daughter struggling with a pram while out with his granddaughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    Masking tape was a response to the failure of existing adhesive tape, which would rip the paint off when it was
                    removed from cars and walls.<br>
                    <br>
                    Often, great ideas arise when there’s a specific problem – that is, when something has failed. <br>
                    The failure itself is what drives you to find a solution, and in this way, failure can function as a driver of progress.<br>
                    <br>
                    Failure is an indispensable feature of creativity. Without a problem, without a failure, without a flaw, without a frustration,
                    innovation has nothing to latch on to. It loses its pivot.

              But none of them saw it that way – rather they framed failure as part of the journey of success.<br>
              <br>
              Successful people tend of have this kind of mindset towards failure, it's called 'Growth Mindset'.<br>
              <br>
              People with a <b>'Growth Mindset'</b> tend to believe that their most basic abilities can be developed
              through hardwork. They do not think that innate intelligence is irrelevant, but believe that they can become
              smarter through persistence and dedication. They regard failure as an inevitable aspect of learning (they pay attention
              to their mistakes and extract learning opportunites from it).<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, people with a <b>'Fixed Mindset'</b> believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence
              or talent, are largely fixed traits. They strongly agree with statements like 'you have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can't really do much to change it.' 
              They tend to ignore failures and miss out on opportunities to learn from it.<br>
              <br>
              Below is an email from the head of HR of a financial institution. It shows the lengths people with 'Fixed Mindset' can go in order 
              to avoid failure.<br>

                When someone is given a new challenge, like giving a major presentation to the clients. It is inevitable that they 
                will be less than perfect first time around. It takes time to build expertise, even for exceptional people. <br>
                But there are huge diffrences in how individuals respond. Some love the challenge. They elicit feedback,
                talk to colleagues, and seek out chances to be involved in future presenations. Always - and I mean always - they improve.
                But others are threatened by the initial 'failure'. In fact, they engage in astonishingly sophisticated avoidance 
                stratergies to ensure that they are never put in that situation ever again. They are sobotaging their progress
                because of their fear of messing up.

              <b>The key message in this book:</b> <br>
              It’s hard to admit to mistakes. But if you want to meet your full potential,
              then you not only have to recognise that you make mistakes but embrace them as part of your path to success. <br>
              We progress fastest when we face up to failure - and learn from it.
