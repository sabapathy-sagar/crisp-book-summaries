                <li>- The Pioneer is an energetic freethinker – full of big ideas</li>
                <li>- Is bursting with creativity and original ideas</li>
                <li>
                  - Pioneers are natural optimists who are happiest when flexing their
                  creative muscles, and they also thrive when their coworkers join in
                  and contribute suggestions
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><u>Negative traits</u></p>
              <ul>
                <li>– Full of big ideas but fuzzy on the details</li>
                <li>
                  – Pioneers’ disinterest in detail means that those around them are
                  forced to pick up the slack
                </li>
                <li>
                  – Pioneers have a bad reputation for suggesting creative solutions
                  then leaving the implementation to others
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><u>How to lead a Pioneer?</u></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  – Pioneers work best in an encouraging atmosphere that celebrates
                  their achievements
                </li>
                <li>
                  – If you’re looking to build a great working relationship with a
                  Pioneer, there’s one word you should try to avoid: no
                </li>
                <li>
                  – If they come up with a poorly-thought-through idea that they’re
                  brimming with enthusiasm about, you could say something like, “Yes,
                  that sounds interesting, and I’m eager to understand more about how
                  it could work in practice.”

            <ul>
              <li>– This working style craves stability and structure</li>
              <li>
                – The Guardian believes that great companies and good decisions are
                both based on solid foundations
              </li>
              <li>
                – If you’re looking for someone to stop you from running into trouble,
                for example, a Guardian is your first port of call
              </li>
              <li>
                – His need for structure and stability means you can count on him to
                plan things carefully and take steps to mitigate the risks involved
              </li>
              <li>– is highly reliable</li>

                – Approach him with a new idea, and he’ll tell you all the reasons why
                it’s too risky, why it won’t work, and why you’d be better off
                sticking with the old way of doing things
              </li>
              <li>– a stickler for the status quo</li>
              <li>
                – Unfortunately, to those around him, the Guardian often seems like a
                conservative stick-in-the-mud who can’t move with the times
              </li>
              <li>
                – And at the current pace of technological change, moving with the
                times is highly important for most organizations. For this reason, the
                Guardian is often the least-appreciated personality type

            <p><u>How to lead a Guardian?</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>– Guardians thrive when given space, time, and clarity</li>
              <li>
                – Thanks to their need for structure, Guardians thrive on planning
              </li>
              <li>– Does not like ambiguity</li>
              <li>
                – Try to give this personality type plenty of information – and time
                to process it – in advance of decision-making or discussion sessions
              </li>
              <li>
                – Be crystal clear about what you expect of them so that they can make

              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                – When a driver comes to a team meeting, she’ll ask you for the facts,

              <li>
                – The Driver’s analytical and inquisitive approach might be great for
                problem-solving, but to her coworkers, she can appear cold and blunt
              </li>
              <li>– Drivers are the least empathetic of all</li>
              <li>– Care only about completing tasks to the best of their ability</li>
              <li>
                – Instead of building consensus among her teammates, a Driver will
                strike out alone until the job is done
              </li>
              <li>– May not have the best social skills</li>

              <li>

              <li>
                – if you work with a Driver, the best thing you can do is explain why

              <li>
                – When it comes to setting expectations and processes, try to build in

              <li>
                – When Integrators are placed in leadership positions, for example,
